  #The data type of the block_header variable is not specified in your question, so I can't give you an accurate answer. 
  #In general, the data type of a block header can depend on the blockchain protocol being used. For example, in Bitcoin, 
  #the block header is a 80-byte data structure that includes a version field, a previous block hash, a Merkle root hash of the transactions in the block, 
  #a timestamp, a difficulty target, a nonce, and some other fields. In Ethereum, the block header is a data structure that includes similar fields, 
  #but with some differences in the exact format and content.

  #In order to write a function that takes in a block header and verifies its validity, 
  #you would need to know the specific blockchain protocol being used and the structure and content of its block header.

#   Field         | Size (bytes) | Description
# --------------|--------------|------------
# Version       | 4            | Block version number
# Prev Block    | 32           | Hash of the previous block header
# Merkle Root   | 32           | Root of the Merkle tree of transactions
# Timestamp     | 4            | Block timestamp in Unix time format
# Bits          | 4            | Difficulty target in compact format
# Nonce         | 4            | Random value used to generate the block header hash

# The hashlib module is a built-in Python module that provides various hash functions, such as SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, BLAKE2s, and BLAKE2b.
